## Born to Dev - Dev Init Program 

This project is an assignment for BornToDev's Dev Init program. It is a program that aims to help people who are interested in becoming a developer to learn and practice their skills. The program consists of 16 weeks. Each week, the students will be assigned a project to work on. The students will be given a week to complete the project. At the end of the week, the students will have to present their project to the class.

I am one of 80 students selected from 600 candidates to participate in this program. This repository will be updated weekly with the projects I complete.
